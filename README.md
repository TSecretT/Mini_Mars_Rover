# Mini_Mars_Rover
In this project we work in a team to get few mini mars rover working to traverse a defined trajectory using computer vision. Various other features will be added and so will be the codes.

These mars rovers were originally designed for the competetion held by math work. Thus, these rovers had original matlab codes. Since, we are trying to use computer vision and see how autonomous control can be done using CV we come up with our own algorithms to work with the rover.

We will keep adding features the first challenge was going straight next challenges include-
1. Arrow detection
2. Traffic light detection
3. Other Vehicle detection
